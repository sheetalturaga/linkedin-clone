# LinkedIn Clone using React + Vite & JavaScript

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Set-up:

- Ensure the NodeJS package is downloaded on to your system. If so, ensure it is updated with the latest version. To do so, `sudo npm install -g npm@latest` on the Mac Terminal. Using `sudo` ensure that the package is updated at the root directory for ease of access and making sure the necessary permissions are provided.
- Run `npm create vite@latest`. If the Vite package is available then it will continue to the Project name option, otherwise will request for permission to download the package.
- Provide the desired Project Name and chose `React` as the framework and `JavaScript` as the variant for this project.
